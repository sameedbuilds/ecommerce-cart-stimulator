# 🛒 E-Commerce Cart Simulator (Python)

A beginner-friendly console-based e-commerce cart system built using core Python concepts like loops, functions, conditionals, lists, and dictionaries.

This project marks my first real-world-style Python program — no tutorials, just logic, effort, and learning by doing.
